### wstream - very WIP code for RTMP streaming

WARNING - this is not proper code yet.
Currently full of asserts and absolutely no error handling.
Once something does not go the way you want - it will just crash/hang.
All the settings & stream key are hardcoded in code.

Currently should be working for YouTube, Twitch and Owncast.
